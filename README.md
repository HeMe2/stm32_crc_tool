# stm32_crc_tool
Calculate a CRC checksum as implemented in the STM32F2 and STM32F4 hardware (On these controllers the CRC-Module cannot be configured). Pass the data as command line argument to this program to calculate the CRC checksum with 32 bits with the same algorithm as on the STM32Fx modules.
